## 🎯 Objective
To transition from "Zero" to a **Technical AI Product Manager** capable of bridging the gap between engineering and strategy. This repository documents my 6-month self-paced curriculum, focusing on:
- **LLM Mechanics:** Understanding Inference, Context Windows, and Temperature.
- **API Integration:** Building actual Python prototypes using Google Gemini.
- **Product Strategy:** Unit economics, latency analysis, and evaluation frameworks.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Tools
* **Language:** Python 3.11+
* **Models:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash / Pro
* **Editor:** VS Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub CLI

## 📂 Project Highlights

### 1. The Ruthless Career Coach (Week 1)
**File:** `career_coach.py`
* **Goal:** Create a persona-based chatbot using System Instructions.
* **PM Insight:** Learned that "Prompt Engineering" is essentially product requirement writing for the model. Changing the `temperature` variable drastically alters the "creativity" vs. "reliability" of the feature.

## My Personal Experience 01/08/2026

I had zero experience with command-line tools, which significantly slowed my progress. When Gemini provided various commands and code snippets, I learned to stay alert: the version it referenced might be outdated, and some packages might already be installed (or incorrectly installed) without my knowledge. As a beginner, understanding this upfront would have saved me considerable time.

My key takeaways: First, be as specific as possible when writing prompts. Second, break large, complex requests into smaller, manageable ones—AI hallucination is a real issue. Third, keep practicing!
